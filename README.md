# Design Patterns

Following the examples from _Head First Design Patterns_. Implementing each pattern in Ruby, C++, and Java. Eventually, would like to follow up with JavaScript, Python, and PHP as well. That way people can see a direct comparison of the same concept and design implemented in multiple languages.

## Strategy pattern

The Strategy Pattern or Policy Pattern is a way of implementing a family of algorithms that can be selected at runtime and are interchangeable. It is a way of encapsulating behavior from the clients that use it. Use this pattern when a behavior has multiple implementations between sub classes, but not each sub class's implementation is unique. Ie... there may be 3 sub classes that handle the behavior one way and another 2 sub classes that handle it another way.
